# Machine-Learining
Machine learning works by training a model on labeled or unlabeled data. During training, the model learns patterns and relationships in the data to make predictions or classifications. Its function is to process input data, adjust its parameters (like weights in neural networks), and optimize performance using algorithms. Once trained, the model is used to analyze new data, make predictions, or automate decision-making tasks.
